# MIDI monitor

Use a Web MIDI enabled browser to monitor incoming MIDI signals through MIDI, USB or bluetooth and route them in any configuration.

Once connected, MIDI inputs show at the top row of the screen. You can select them and a list of available outputs will show. Click to create an active MIDI link. All input signals (except sync clock) will be sent immediately any number to connected outputs.

No more need to run DAW to route MIDI â€“ just open a browser tab and have fun! The app will show all incoming notes and CC changes in a clean table. You can click or tap on a note or move a slider on the screen to send a MIDI message to all active outputs.

Click on [MIDI] button to play/stop midi sequencers, clear the monitor and select active outputs (currently in development). The app can be used both on desktop and mobile devices. Plug your devices into a powered USB-hub and connect it to your Android device with an OTG cable adapter or to an iPhone or an iPad with the lightning/usb adapter. 


The Web MIDI technology has been already implemented in Chrome and Opera on desktop and Android phones and tablets. For iOS devices there is a dedicated free [Web MIDI Browser](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/web-midi-browser/id953846217).
